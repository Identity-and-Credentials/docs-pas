title: Isolation Segment v5.0 Release notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

Here you will find the release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  - ✨ `route_registrar` now emites route registration events immediately upon startup, rather than waiting for a full registration interval to pass. This will cut down on accidental TTL expiry incurred by restarting route-registrar.
  - ✨ The `router.enable_log_attempts_details` property has been added to allow operators to configure Gorouter to log additional information about retried attempts to send requests to backends. Thanks @maxmoehl!
  - 🐛Specifying multiple CA certs to route_registrar via `route_registrar.routing_api.ca_certs` will now render correctly as multiple certs in a single CA file.
  - 🐛 Routing API clients now correctly refresh their UAA tokens prior to expiry. This should help prevent `route_registrar` from crashing whenever the token expires.
  - Golang package dependency bumps

  ## Changes
  ⚠️We have removed the garden-healthcheck job from garden while we investigate a way to make it less painful. From v1.22.6 through v1.28.0, garden restarts with a high container count could result in BOSH deploys failing due to a race condition between garden, bpm, monit, and garden-healthchecker. This will be re-enabled at a later time when we resolve the race condition.

  ## Release Notes
  - **[Breaking Change]** nfsv3driver job no longer supports `allowed-in-mount`, `default-in-mount` and `enable_unique_volume_ids` properties. Former default values for these properties can no longer be overridden.
  - **[Feature Improvement]** `nfsbrokerpush` errand produces clearer error messages when the broker cannot contact CredHub at startup.
  ## Dependencies
  - The `nfsbrokerpush` errand requires the `cf-cli-6-linux` job from [cf-cli-release](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/bosh-packages/cf-cli-release?all=1) to be colocated on the errand VM.
  - This version requires the `mapfs` job from [mapfs-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/mapfs-release/releases) to be colocated on the cell.

          <pre style="max-width: 30em">
  ## Release Notes
  - As of v6.1.0, `nfsbrokerpush.create_credhub_security_group` defaults to `true`.  This will cause the `nfsbrokerpush` errand to create a running security group for the nfsbroker application that opens traffic to credhub's ports (typically 8844).
  - Various go module dependencies are updated.
  - Code for managing `mount` command invocation in the `nfsv3driver` job is refactored.
  ## Dependencies
  - The `nfsbrokerpush` errand requires the `cf-cli-6-linux` job from [cf-cli-release](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/bosh-packages/cf-cli-release?all=1) to be colocated on the errand VM.
  - This version requires the `mapfs` job from [mapfs-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/mapfs-release/releases) to be colocated on the cell.

          <pre style="max-width: 30em">
  ## Release Notes
  - **[Breaking Change]** As of version 6.0, the `nfsbrokerpush` errand no longer accepts database properties, and no longer supports migration of data from SQL into CredHub.  CredHub properties are required in the `nfsbrokerpush` errand, and it is expected that any SQL based service instances have already been migrated to CredHub by invoking `nfsbrokerpush` in a previous version.
  ## Dependencies
  - The `nfsbrokerpush` errand requires the `cf-cli-6-linux` job from [cf-cli-release >= v1.6.0](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/bosh-packages/cf-cli-release?all=1) to be colocated on the errand VM.
  - This version requires the `mapfs` job from [mapfs-release >= v1.1.5](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/mapfs-release/releases) to be colocated on the  cell.  Using older mapfs releases will cause the nfsv3driver job to fail with a missing  link.

  ⚠️⚠️⚠️
  **This version of golang has a known issue that may cause backend request failures that previously returned 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 to instead return a 502. Additionally stale routes may not get pruned properly. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.**
  ## Changes
  - Dependency updates (cf cli, healthchecker, golang)
  - Many CI Updates - Thanks @jrussett!
  - 🐛[#310]The routing_utils route loader now sets the route service url when loading. Thanks @domdom82 !
  - 🐛Two issues in route_registrar were fixed that led to routes expiring and then being re-registered with the same details:
  - Starting in v0.245.0, route_registrar no longer retried UAA connections when getting a token from UAA. Instead, the failure would cause route_registrar to restart, and reset it's emitter intervals.
  - The built in route expiry has been increased from RegistrationInterval + 2 seconds to 2.1 * RegistrationInterval. This prevent routes from expiring during the course of a route_registrar restart.
  - 🐛If tcp_router received routing events during its BulkSync cycle, it would always rewrite the haproxy configuration, and reload the haproxy process. This would occur regardless of whether the events required a new haproxy config. It now only updates the config + reloads haproxy if changes are necessary.
