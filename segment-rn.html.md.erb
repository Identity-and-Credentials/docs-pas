Here you will find the release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
