<% current_page.data.title = "Isolation Segment" + " " + vars.v_major_version + " Release Notes" %>

This topic contains release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for <%= Date.today.year %>.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## What's Changed
  - When the `router.ca_certs` property switched from a multi-line string of certs, to an array of certs, gorouter started failing to start up if any of the certs provided were invalid. Previously they were ignored. This has been reverted, so that any invalid CA certs are ignored during startup. Thanks @ameowlia!

  ## What's Changed
  * Switch to healthecker package in cf-networking-helpers by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/302
  * Add healthchecker package to sync-package-specs file by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/303
  * **Potential Breaking Change:** In preperation for mtls between gorouter and routing api, add gorouter backends ca to routing-api. Rendering these certs depends on routing-api consuming a link from gorouter. If you have multiple gorouter instance groups (for example in the case of isolation segments), you will need to rename bosh links to prevent the error "Multiple link providers found. For an example of link renaming, see [this ops file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/main/operations/test/add-persistent-isolation-segment-router.yml#L74) by @reneighbor in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/300

<% if not vars.platform_code == 'OFFLINE' %>
To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html).
<% end %>

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>. For more information,
see the [Ops Manager documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/index.html).

## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

### Max Request Header Size Now Defaults to 48kb
Upgrading to IST 4.0 will automatically set **Max request header size in kb** to 48,
unless the pre-existing configuration was already lower. Lowering this value establishes
a better security posture for TAS for VMs and applications. This value can still be configured
back up to 1024kb in the Networking tab if necessary.  Any requests with headers larger than
this value will receive a 431 status code.

### Add Validation for **Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter** Property
IST 4.0 contains validations for the **Certificate Authorities trusted by the
Gorouter** property in the Networking tab. Any entries that are not valid CA
certificates will result in an error in OpsManager. Users should remove or replace
invalid entries.

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

There are no known issues for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
