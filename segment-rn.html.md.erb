title: Isolation Segment v4.0 Release Notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

Here you will find the release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

### <a id='4.0.1'></a> 4.0.1+LTS-T

**Release Date:** 05/17/2023

* **[Security Fix]** Whereas TAS 4.0.0 was unaffected by [CVE-2023-20882](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2023-20882-gorouter-pruning-via-client-disconnect-resulting-in-dos/), IST 4.0.1 updates to a routing-release version containing the fix.

* Bump bpm to version `1.2.0`
* Bump cf-networking to version `3.25.1`
* Bump cflinuxfs3 to version `0.364.0`

  ## Changes
  ⚠️We have removed the garden-healthcheck job from garden while we investigate a way to make it less painful. From v1.22.6 through v1.28.0, garden restarts with a high container count could result in BOSH deploys failing due to a race condition between garden, bpm, monit, and garden-healthchecker. This will be re-enabled at a later time when we resolve the race condition.

## <a id='install'></a> How to install

<% if vars.platform_code != 'OFFLINE' %>
To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html).
<% end %>

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>. For more information, on how to install Ops Manager,
see the [Ops Manager documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/index.html).

## <a id='new-features'></a> New features in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

### Max request header size now defaults to 48 KB
When you Upgrade to IST v4.0 it automatically sets **Max request header size in KB** to 48 KB,
unless the pre-existing configuration was already lower. Lowering this value establishes better security for TAS for VMs and applications. If necessary, this value can still be configured
back up to 1024 KB in the **Networking** tab. Any requests with headers larger than
this value receive a 431 status code.

### Add validation for Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter property
IST 4.0 contains validations for the Certificate Authorities (CA) trusted by the
Gorouter property in the **Networking** tab. Any entries that are not valid CA
certificates can result in an error in Ops Manager. You must remove or replace
invalid entries.

### Option to activate (deprecated) Global Log Rate Limit is removed

This feature was in beta until IST v3.0, when it was deprecated following the introduction of app log rate limits.

For details, see [Isolation Segment v3.0 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/segment-rn.html#global-log-rate-limit-is-deprecated-15) and also [App Log Rate Feature](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/runtime-rn.html#app-log-rate-limits-for-orgs-spaces-and-individual-apps-14).
The option to enable this feature has now been removed, and you must apply app log rate limits instead.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you were using this feature to limit your overall app log
throughput, then you might see an increase in log load after you upgrade. </p>
To
mitigate this, either:

* Scale up your logging system before you upgrade to IST v4.0 to compensate for the increased log load.

  Or

* Upgrade to TAS/IST v3.0 first to set app-level log rate limits while retaining the global log rate limit. For details, see [App Log Rate Limits](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/app-log-rate-limits.html).

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known issues

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following known issues:

### Stale routes might not be pruned properly in Gorouter

In addition, request failures that previously resulted in 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 HTTP Status codes might now return Status Code 502 instead
