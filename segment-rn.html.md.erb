This topic contains release notes for Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for <%= Date.today.year %>.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see
[How Do I Become a Certified Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/)
on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle
releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

To install Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing Isolation Segment](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-13/operating/installing-pcf-is.html).

To install Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install Ops Manager v2.10.
For more information, see the [Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/index.html) documentation.


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='dynamic-asg'></a> Dynamic App Security Group Rules

TAS for VMs v2.13 introduces dynamic App Security Groups (ASGs).

ASGs are a collection of egress rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where app or task instances send traffic.
Previously, updating an existing ASG required you to restart the app before the ASG went into effect.

Dynamic ASGs can automatically update security groups without requiring an app restart.
If you have existing ASGs, you can run any of the security group cf CLI commands, including `cf bind-security-group` and `update-security-group`, and the changes apply automatically to any running apps.

For more information about ASGs, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html).


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='certs-require-san'></a> Gorouter Certificates Require a SAN Extension

In Isolation Segment v2.13, all Gorouter certificates require a valid subjectAltName (SAN) extension.
If any Gorouter certificates lack a SAN, Go clients cannot connect to servers and deployment fails.

Before you upgrade to Isolation Segment v2.13, you must:

  1. Verify that all certificates in Ops Manager use a valid SAN. If they do not, rotate your certificates using a valid SAN.
  1. Verify that all external systems that the Gorouter connects to have certificates with a valid SAN. If you use route services, this includes either the route services themselves or the load balancer in front of the route service.

If you need to complete a deployment before configuring new Gorouter certificates, select **Enable temporary workaround for certs without SANs** in the **Networking** pane of the TAS for VMs tile.

For more information about updating certificates, see [Routing and Golang 1.15 X.509 CommonName deprecation](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Routing-and-golang-1-15-X-509-CommonName-deprecation) in the Knowledge Base.

### <a id='ip-leading-zero'></a> Golang v1.17 Rejects IP Addresses with Leading Zeros

Golang v1.17 contains stricter IP parsing standards, so IP addresses with leading zeros in any octets cause a BOSH template failure.
Operators can remove the leading zeros and try deploying again.
This affects properties that feed into all releases that use Golang v1.17.
For a complete list, see [TAS for VMs Components Use Golang v1.17](runtime-rn.html#golang-1-17).

Syslog drains and metric registrar endpoints that are registered using user-provided services might also be affected.

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

Isolation Segment <%= vars.v_major_version %> currently has no known issues.
